👋 Hello, and welcome to my blog!  
I'm **Frédéric Klein**, a **Solution Engineer at Red Hat**, where I help teams **design and run modern architectures** using **Kubernetes** and **Red Hat technologies** — with a strong focus on **developer experience**, **scalability**, and **real-world use cases**.

I use this space to share what I learn, what I test, and what I build — whether it's around **cloud platforms**, **automation**, **AI**, **privacy**, or just good engineering practices. You’ll find here a mix of **technical content**, **ideas**, **feedback from the field**, and a few personal thoughts.

If you're into **cloud-native development**, **DevSecOps**, or just curious about how to make tech work better for teams, you're in the right place.
